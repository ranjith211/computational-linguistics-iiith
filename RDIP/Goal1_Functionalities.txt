The Functionalities in the experiment are:
1)A dropdown menu which displays a text "---Select Language---", it contains English and Hindi the languages that are available to choose.

2)We need to select one option from the dropdown menu i.e., English or Hindi, then a sentence "Form a sentence (Declarative or Interrogative or any other type) from the given words", words which are not in a correct order are displayed then words need to be selected to form a correct sentence.

3)After selecting atleast one word,"reform-the-sentence" button is being activated.

4)After clicking the "reform-the-sentence" button,the words are put back and there would be a chance to reselect the words again.

5)Once all the words are selected, "Check the corectness of this sentence" button is activated.

6)If the selection order of words forms a correct sentence, if we click on "Check the corectness of this sentence" button "Right Answer!!!" is displayed, acknowledging that the sentence is a well formed sentence.

7)If the sentence formed is wrong,a text saying "Wrong answer!!!" is displayed on the screen and a button that says, "get correct sentence" is activated on the screen.

8)After clicking the button "get correct sentence",you will be shown all the possible sentences that can be formed using the given words.

9)Along with the possible sentences a button which says "Hide the correct Sentence" is displayed and activated.

10)Once we click on the "Hide the correct Sentence" button the correct sentences are disappeared and a button saying "Get Answers" is activated.

11)which on click again displayes the correct sentences.

12)Along with the above functionalities, I think it would be better to have a functionality that can unselect the words from the selected words.

13)The "get correct Sentence" button should be avtivated even if the user forms a correct sentence such that he can know the remaining correct answers.
